# Gcliberty Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build a deployable Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL online banking platform with user banking workflows, admin command center, KYC, wallets, cards, transfers, support chat, email broadcasts, settings, and auditability.

**Architecture:** The application is a single Next.js app using App Router route handlers for APIs, Prisma for PostgreSQL, JWT session cookies for authentication, server-rendered protected dashboards, and client components only for interactive forms, chat, and admin mutations. Storage is S3-compatible when configured and local-development backed otherwise; realtime support chat is served by the custom Socket.IO production server.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15.5.19, React 19.2.7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn-style source components, Prisma 6.19.3, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, Nodemailer, jose, bcryptjs, Vitest.
